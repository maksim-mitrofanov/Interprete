# Interprete
When I was prepairing for my IELTS exam, I had to learn a lot of new english words and their definitions. After a few months of manually typing them in different websites like [dictionary.cambridge.org](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/) and [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/org) I decided to automate definition lookup and made a small web parcing app.

## Doing things my own way ðŸ¦„ 
Initially I wanted to use some of the public APIs to do this job. But apparently some of them were paid (like Google Translate) or absurdly hard to obtain (cambridge dictionary). So, I was left with nothing but to use some soup framework to pull data out of HTML. 

Not the most efficient way of getting data from web, but it works! âœ¨
